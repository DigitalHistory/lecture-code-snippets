* JS Code Snippets from HIS393

This very basic repository contains code snippets from lecture slides in [[https://digitalhistory.github.io/][HIS393: Digital History]] at the University of Toronto. 

The idea is just to provide direct access to all the code so you can try to follow along in your text editor, most likely using [[https://quokkajs.com/docs/][Quokka.js]] to evaluate variables and function calls. 

** Usage

There's no need to fork this repo; just clone it and keep it somewhere accessible on your laptop. Run ~npm install~ to help VSCode figure out your coding requirements. Then just open the file you're interested in and start Quokka with ~Quokka.js: Start on current File~ in the Command Palette. From that point on you should be able to follow along with the lecture.
